            <h2>Dungeons & Dragons</h2>
            <p>The following content is, exclusively about the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). Wait, you
                don't know what D&D is? That's okay, D&D is a tabletop roleplaying game, where players interpret
                what
                their adventurers do and the Dungeon Master describe the world and the consequences of the players
                actions. In this page we have a snippet in the Wizard Class.</p>

            <h2>Wizards!</h2>
            <p>Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions
                of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her
                spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration
                that engulfs the soldiers.</p>
            <p>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare
                stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is
                complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of
                brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p>
            <p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed
                with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions
                more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p>
            <p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on
                the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing
                lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other
                planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells
                change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
